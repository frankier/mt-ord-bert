link_rt_exp_results.goodclass.nodiscrim contains a run with:
 * A good classifier run
 * Everything else with single discrimination (bad)
 * SLURM logs in link_rt_exp_results.goodclass.nodiscrim/logs

Starting a run which
 * Logs to W&B
 * Misses out class since this was fairly successful already last time and has no tweaks
 * Everything else gets a run with per_task and multi discrimination
   * Previously everything was run with single discrimination which is probably pretty much useless/wrong

It looks like the boundaries have not been being learnt because of a method
which doesn't propagate gradients which probably explains the lousy performance

10:00 Starting training of:
